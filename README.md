# Bikeshare Project
This project analyzes bikeshare data for a fictional bike-sharing system in multiple cities. It 
provides insights into ridership patterns, popular stations, and trip duration statistics.

## Description
The Bikeshare project consists of Python scripts that allow users to explore bikeshare data 
interactively. It includes the following files:
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python script that allows users to interactively explore bikeshare data.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for use, and details 
about the data analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Bikeshare project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following 
command:
git clone <https://github.com/redkahuna/pdsnd_github>
2. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download Python from 
[python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the required Python packages by running the following 
command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Script**: Run the `bikeshare.py` script using the following command:
python bikeshare.py
5. **Explore the Data**: Follow the prompts in the terminal to interactively explore bikeshare data 
for different cities, time periods, and analysis options.

## Project Details
The `bikeshare.py` script allows users to:
- Select a city (Chicago, New York City, or Washington) for analysis.
- Filter data by month and day of the week.
- View summary statistics such as popular stations, trip duration, and user demographics.

## Usage
The Bikeshare project is intended to be used as a tool for analyzing bikeshare data and gaining 
insights into ridership patterns. Users can explore various aspects of bikeshare usage and generate 
reports based on their specific queries.
